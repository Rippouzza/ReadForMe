**ReadForMe** is a mobile application designed to assist individuals with visual impairments by recognizing objects in their environment and reading them aloud. This app addresses the challenge of visually impaired people struggling to identify their surroundings and offers a practical solution to help them navigate their environment more independently.

## üöÄ Features

- **Object Detection:** Captures objects in the environment and recognizes them using the Google Cloud Vision API.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Reads aloud the recognized objects for immediate auditory feedback.
- **Simple User Interaction:** Users press a button on the home screen to open the camera and capture images.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React Native:** Framework for building the app with a single codebase for both iOS and Android.
- **Expo:** Tool for building and compiling the app.
- **Google Cloud Vision API:** Utilized for object recognition and analysis.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Provides speech output for the recognized object descriptions.
